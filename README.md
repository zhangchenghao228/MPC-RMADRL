# MPC-RMADRL for Multi-Zone HVAC Control

This repository provides the open-source implementation of the **MPC-RMADRL** algorithm for multi-zone HVAC control.

It includes EnergyPlus IDF files for both **5-zone** and **28-zone** building models, two EPW weather files for **Jinan, China**, and the implementation of the proposed **MPC-RMADRL** control algorithm.
